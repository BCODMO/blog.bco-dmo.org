We know what you're thinking... "You guys have been saying your new website is coming for a while now." And you'd be right. A little over four years if you've been counting. Turns out, completely redesigning your website while also rearchitecting the entire system behind it and ensuring fidelity of all the data and information it contains takes a little longer than we anticipated. But we're confident it was worth the wait. And, we're excited to finally share it with you.

If you've used the current site in the past few months - whether to publish or search for data, you might have noticed the unassuming little green banner at the top of our data pages that let you take a sneak peek into what what the new site will look like. The new webpages look dramatically different from the now decade's old site that you may be familiar with- and that's by design. A design that you, our user community, helped shape during focus groups, through surveys, and engagement with us at meetings. The look and feel have been designed to visually begin aligning data publications pages with those of their scholarly publication counterparts, while still retaining all the robust metadata needed for determining fitness for purpose and reuse. We've also replaced our previous means of data access and download, and provided the ability to sort and filter observations while viewing them from the dataset's landing page. For those who appreciate deeper interrogation or subsetting and downloading in alternative formats, our fully functioning ERDDAP server provides you with this capability.

There are stil some features to come on the new site, including a data cart for aggregating and downloading multiple datasets, and usage metrics displaying views and downloads of each dataset... so stay tuned for news on these subsequent feature launches! And if you're just not ready to make the full switch over to searching and accessing data using the new site, that's okay; we'll be keeping the old site accessible for 2 months at {% include link.html external=true url="https://OSPREY.bco-dmo.org/" text="OSPREY.bco-dmo.org" %} and will clearly communicate as the final sunset date approaches. 

Thanks for your patience while we developed the new BCO-DMO website and please let us know your thoughts at feedback@bco-dmo.org.
